Step-by-Step Guide
1
Launch Burp Suite from terminal or menu
2
Configure browser to use proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
3
Install Burp CA certificate in browser for HTTPS
4
Browse target website - traffic appears in Proxy > HTTP history
5
Identify interesting requests to analyze
6
Send requests to Repeater for manual testing
7
Use Scanner (Pro only) for automated vulnerability detection
Understanding the Output
Burp shows HTTP requests/responses in detail. The Target tab shows site structure, Proxy shows intercepted traffic, Scanner shows vulnerabilities with severity ratings (High/Medium/Low/Info).

Important Warnings
•
Only test websites you own or have authorization to test
•
Intercepting others' traffic is illegal
•
Be careful with Intruder - can generate many requests
•
Community edition has limited features
